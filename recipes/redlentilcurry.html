    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>One of my go-to quick and healthy meals. I make this a lot, especially in college!
        Credits to https://rainbowplantlife.com/ for the recipe! </p>
    <p>This Vegan Red Lentil Curry is a fan favorite and the BEST lentil curry you will ever try! 
        It's easy and quick, making it a perfect weeknight dinner! Plus, it's creamy and indulgent 
        but made with wholesome vegan ingredients!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon refined or virgin coconut oil, or a neutral-flavored oil</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 inch piece of fresh ginger, peeled and minced or grated</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh turmeric, or 1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground coriander</li>

        <li>2 teaspoons curry powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>

        <li>Freshly cracked black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup (180-190g) red lentils, or split red lentils (the split variety will cook a bit quicker)</li>

        <li>3 tablespoons unsweetened creamy almond butter</li>
        <li>1/2 a small lemon, juiced</li>
